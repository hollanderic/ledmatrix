-Modify makefile (and potentially design) to also support tinyFPGAbx
    Only supports icestick as it is now

-Double buffer the data so spi writes to background and flips page after write

-Add support for commands over spi
    presently, CS going high designates start of frame (addr 0x0000 in framebuffer)
    and will write sequentially until cs goes low.
    *Implement as first word of transfer being a command token

-Sort out endianness of spi writes

-Support interfaces other than SPI
  -MIPI-DSI
  -QSPI
  -i2c (probably low value, too slow)
  -Parallel (should have enough IO on tinyFPGA)
